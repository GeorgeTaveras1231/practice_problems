# I have an array stockPricesYesterday where:
#    The indices are the time, as a number of minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
#    The values are the price of Apple stock at that time, in dollars.
#    For example, the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, so stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.
#    Write an efficient algorithm for computing the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday. For this problem, we won't allow "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell.

  stock_prices.each.with_index(1) do |first_price, i|
    stock_prices[i..stock_prices.count].each do |second_price|
